Bugs found during manual testing here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/10qH_Z6TL4VBySUAGyeAKw8POHPTsiOlxdn8sabw0vEw/edit?usp=sharing

The automated tests have been done using cypress

## Installation

Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidCirlanaru/bitdefender_homework.git
```

```bash
cd bitdefender_homework
```

```bash
npm install
```


## Usage
Run:
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

Inside the new browser window that should open, click on the create-report.spec.js file. All the automated tests should run. (Some are deliberately supposed to fail).
